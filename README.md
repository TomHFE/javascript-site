1. installation 
Once you are on this repository, click the small arrow on the green Code button at the top right of the repo contents. From here, select Download Zip. This will download the entire GitHub repository as a zipped folder (git Kraken 2023).
Open your zipped folder on your computer and then view these files with your preffered code editor for example VS Code. 
Once open find out how to view these files on live server. If you are a VS Code customer you will need to go to a file that ends in .html and right click and click on the option that says open live server.
